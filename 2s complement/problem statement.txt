Problem Statement

One of the basics of Computer Science is knowing how numbers are represented in 2's complement. Imagine that you write down all numbers between A and B inclusive in 2's complement representation using 32 bits. How many 1's will you write down in all ?

Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases T (<=1000). Each of the next T lines contains two integers A and B.

Output:
Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case.

Constraints:
-2^31 <= A <= B <= 2^31 - 1

Sample Input:
3
-2 0
-3 4
-1 4

Sample Output:
63
99
37

Explanation:
For the first case, -2 contains 31 1's followed by a 0, -1 contains 32 1's and 0 contains 0 1's. Thus the total is 63.
For the second case, the answer is 31 + 31 + 32 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 99
